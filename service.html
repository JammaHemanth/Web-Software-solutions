<h2>Data Science</h2>
As evident from 'scientist' they fetch data, construct and maintain databases, clean and segregate data for various needs and also work on data visualisation and analysis.
At the top lies a data science job. These have a diverse set of profiles under them and require particular expertise. Data science certification is mandatory to get a job. The scope for data scientists is lower compared to big data due to the different (individual) profiles that lie under the umbrella of data science.
 <br> <br>
<h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
Cloud computing is changing the hiring pattern in the IT industry. In the coming days, IT companies will replace professionals having generic skills with those having cloud computing expertise.
